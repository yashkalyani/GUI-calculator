# GUI-calculator
Simple calculator made with Python using Tkinter.
The file calulator.py contains the code for a simple calculator that has been made using python. It is essentially a Graphical User Interface which I have coded by importing the Tkinter library. It is fairly simple and changes can be made as per the user's choice. Since this is a "simple" version of a very advanced calculator changes will be made and the files will be uploaded as it comes.
